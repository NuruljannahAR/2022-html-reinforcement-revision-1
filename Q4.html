    <p>The infamous french baguettes. Crunchy on the outside and soft on the inside. 
        You can eat it on it's own or best is to pair it with cheese and your preferred protein!
        Some might not like baguettes because they can turn hard after a few days.
        There are some delicious bread pudding recipes we can try to make from stale baguettes.
        There are nothing quite tasty like a freshly baked baguettes,
        Be sure to get one if you visit the bakery! </p>
