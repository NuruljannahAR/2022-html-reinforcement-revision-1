<h1>Myself</h1>
<h3>About Me</h3>
    <p>I am a youthtech technical specialist trainee working for Empower2FREE. 
        I will end my traineeship soon in June.
        Hope to learn as much as I can before I graduate from the program. </p>
<h3>My Ambition</h3>
        <p>I aspire to be a front-end developer working on 
            interactive and fun websites. 
            I hope the work I do will impact positive change in the community.
